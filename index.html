    <label for="1Nephi8" style="font-size: x-large">1 Nephi Chapter 8</label
    ><br />
    <p id="1Nephi8">
      <br />1 And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner of
      seeds of every kind, both of grain of every kind, and also of the seeds of
      fruit of every kind. <br />2 And it came to pass that while my father
      tarried in the wilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I have dreamed
      a dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision. <br />3 And behold,
      because of the thing which I have seen, I have reason to rejoice in the
      Lord because of Nephi and also of Sam; for I have reason to suppose that
      they, and also many of their seed, will be saved. <br />4 But behold,
      Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly because of you; for behold, methought
      I saw in my dream, a dark and dreary wilderness. <br />5 And it came to
      pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a white robe; and he came and
      stood before me. <br />6 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and
      bade me follow him. <br />7 And it came to pass that as I followed him I
      beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste. <br />8 And after I
      had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto
      the Lord that he would have mercy on me, according to the multitude of his
      tender mercies. <br />9 And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the
      Lord I beheld a large and spacious field. <br />10 And it came to pass
      that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.
      <br />11 And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit
      thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before
      tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all
      the whiteness that I had ever seen. <br />12 And as I partook of the fruit
      thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began
      to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that
      it was desirable above all other fruit. <br />13 And as I cast my eyes
      round about, that perhaps I might discover my family also, I beheld a
      river of water; and it ran along, and it was near the tree of which I was
      partaking the fruit. <br />14 And I looked to behold from whence it came;
      and I saw the head thereof a little way off; and at the head thereof I
      beheld your mother Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and they stood as if they
      knew not whither they should go. <br />15 And it came to pass that I
      beckoned unto them; and I also did say unto them with a loud voice that
      they should come unto me, and partake of the fruit, which was desirable
      above all other fruit. <br />16 And it came to pass that they did come
      unto me and partake of the fruit also. <br />17 And it came to pass that I
      was desirous that Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of the fruit
      also; wherefore, I cast mine eyes towards the head of the river, that
      perhaps I might see them. <br />18 And it came to pass that I saw them,
      but they would not come unto me and partake of the fruit. <br />19 And I
      beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the river, and led
      to the tree by which I stood. <br />20 And I also beheld a strait and
      narrow path, which came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree by
      which I stood; and it also led by the head of the fountain, unto a large
      and spacious field, as if it had been a world. <br />21 And I saw
      numberless concourses of people, many of whom were pressing forward, that
      they might obtain the path which led unto the tree by which I stood.
      <br />22 And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the
      path which led to the tree. <br />23 And it came to pass that there arose
      a mist of darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness,
      insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that
      they wandered off and were lost. <br />24 And it came to pass that I
      beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the
      end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of
      darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and
      partake of the fruit of the tree. <br />25 And after they had partaken of
      the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were
      ashamed. <br />26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the
      other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it
      stood as it were in the air, high above the earth. <br />27 And it was
      filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their
      manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of
      mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were
      partaking of the fruit. <br />28 And after they had tasted of the fruit
      they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they
      fell away into forbidden paths and were lost. <br />29 And now I, Nephi,
      do not speak all the words of my father. <br />30 But, to be short in
      writing, behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came
      and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their
      way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came
      forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree. <br />31 And he
      also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards that great and
      spacious building. <br />32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in
      the depths of the fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in
      strange roads. <br />33 And great was the multitude that did enter into
      that strange building. And after they did enter into that building they
      did point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of the
      fruit also; but we heeded them not. <br />34 These are the words of my
      father: For as many as heeded them, had fallen away. <br />35 And Laman
      and Lemuel partook not of the fruit, said my father. <br />36 And it came
      to pass after my father had spoken all the words of his dream or vision,
      which were many, he said unto us, because of these things which he saw in
      a vision, he exceedingly feared for Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest
      they should be cast off from the presence of the Lord. <br />37 And he did
      exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would
      hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord would be merciful to them, and
      not cast them off; yea, my father did preach unto them. <br />38 And after
      he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto them of many things,
      he bade them to keep the commandments of the Lord; and he did cease
      speaking unto them.

    ><br />
    <p id="1Nephi11">
      <br />1 For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my
      father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known
      unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit
      of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had
      before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot. <br />2 And
      the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou? <br />3 And I said: I
      desire to behold the things which my father saw. <br />4 And the Spirit
      said unto me: Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath
      spoken? <br />5 And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words
      of my father. <br />6 And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried
      with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he
      is God over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou,
      Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most high God; wherefore,
      thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired. <br />7 And behold
      this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign, that after thou hast
      beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt
      also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and
      after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of
      God. <br />8 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look! And I
      looked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my father
      had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all
      beauty; and the whiteness thereof did exceed the whiteness of the driven
      snow. <br />9 And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto
      the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is precious
      above all. <br />10 And he said unto me: What desirest thou? <br />11 And
      I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof—for I spake unto him
      as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet
      nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto
      me as a man speaketh with another. <br />12 And it came to pass that he
      said unto me: Look! And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw him
      not; for he had gone from before my presence. <br />13 And it came to pass
      that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other
      cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I
      beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white. <br />14 And it
      came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood
      before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou? <br />15 And I
      said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.
      <br />16 And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?
      <br />17 And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children;
      nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things. <br />18 And he
      said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son
      of God, after the manner of the flesh. <br />19 And it came to pass that I
      beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been
      carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto
      me, saying: Look! <br />20 And I looked and beheld the virgin again,
      bearing a child in her arms. <br />21 And the angel said unto me: Behold
      the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the
      meaning of the tree which thy father saw? <br />22 And I answered him,
      saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the
      hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above
      all things. <br />23 And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most
      joyous to the soul. <br />24 And after he had said these words, he said
      unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among
      the children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him.
      <br />25 And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my
      father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living
      waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the
      love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation
      of the love of God. <br />26 And the angel said unto me again: Look and
      behold the condescension of God! <br />27 And I looked and beheld the
      Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the
      prophet who should prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went
      forth and was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the
      heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon
      him in the form of a dove. <br />28 And I beheld that he went forth
      ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes
      were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out
      from among them. <br />29 And I also beheld twelve others following him.
      And it came to pass that they were carried away in the Spirit from before
      my face, and I saw them not. <br />30 And it came to pass that the angel
      spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the heavens
      open again, and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they
      did minister unto them. <br />31 And he spake unto me again, saying: Look!
      And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children
      of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were
      afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean
      spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me. And they
      were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the
      unclean spirits were cast out. <br />32 And it came to pass that the angel
      spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of
      God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God
      was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record. <br />33 And I, Nephi,
      saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the
      world. <br />34 And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth,
      that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the
      Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the Lord. <br />35
      And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I beheld that
      they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the building which
      my father saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying:
      Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel
      hath gathered together to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
      <br />36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great
      and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell, and the
      fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto
      me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds,
      tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the
      Lamb.
